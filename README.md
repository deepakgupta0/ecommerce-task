### PWA Implementation

This application includes a service worker to enable offline capabilities and adhere to PWA standards.

#### Service Worker

The service worker is implemented using Workbox. It handles precaching of assets and runtime caching for API requests and images.

#### Offline UI/UX

The application provides a smooth offline experience by caching critical assets and displaying a custom offline page when there is no network connectivity.

## Usage

### Folder Structure

- `src/components`: Contains reusable components like Header, Footer, Product Card, etc.
- `src/hooks`: Custom hooks like `useFetch`.
- `src/redux`: Redux Toolkit slices and store configuration.
- `src/pages`: Different pages of the application.
- `src/service-worker.js`: Service worker configuration.
- `src/serviceWorkerRegistration.js`: Service worker registration.

### Components

#### Header

The header component with navigation links.

#### Footer

The footer component with site information.

#### Product Card

A reusable product card component that displays product details, ratings, and more.

#### Cart

Handles the shopping cart UI and functionality.

#### Shimmer

Displays a loading animation while fetching product data.

### State Management

Global state management is handled using Redux Toolkit. The store is configured in `src/redux/store.js`, and slices are defined in `src/redux/slices`.

### Routing

Routing is managed using React Router DOM. Define your routes in `src/App.js`.
